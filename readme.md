#### Note

Flag emoji don't work on chrome windows as Windows doesn't have any default font support for those special emoji
as a work around i've import the mozilla emoji font to get icon in the sheet but i can't use this imported font
in the text svg flag emoji that got display in the chart unless i embed the font as base64 in the svg himself 
which cause massive lag because each flag now store around 1mb of font content
